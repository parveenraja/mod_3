		<p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.It can be compared to mixing a curry, later combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as among its diaspora. It is also prepared in other regions such as Iraqi Kurdistan. It is made with Indian spices, rice, meat (chicken, beef, goat, pork, lamb, prawn, or fish), or eggs. The word 'biryani' is derived from a Persian word, birian, which means fried before cooking. It is one of the most popular dishes, which has acquired a niche for itself in South Asian cuisine.</p></div>

		<p>Fried rice is a dish of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood, or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another dish. Fried rice is a popular component of East Asian, Southeast Asian and certain South Asian cuisines. As a homemade dish, fried rice is typically made with ingredients left over from other dishes, leading to countless variations. Fried rice first developed during the Sui Dynasty in China and as such all fried rice dishes can trace their origins to Chinese fried rice.</p>
